### Ban Rationale

The primary goals of Astro are:
*  Balanced faction representation
*  Counterplay and interactivity
*  Fun, varied games
*  Wide pool of usable identities and strategies

Therefore cards which:
*  Negatively impact faction viability to a large degree
*  Promote uninteractive, solitaire gameplay
*  Enable the same card to be played reliably every game or many times in one game
*  Reduce the viability of a large number of identities
*  Are widely agreed by the community to reduce the enjoyment of the format

are subject to scrutiny and possible inclusion on the ban list.

Power alone is not the measure by which cards are included on the banlist, but may be a cause for one of these conditions.
